# Udacity Machine Learning Project
Repository storing all my Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree projects. I also completed over 260 hours of video tutorials on topics including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning (NN and CNN) as part of this course.

The final 'capstone' project is the culmination of the studying and other project submissions.
